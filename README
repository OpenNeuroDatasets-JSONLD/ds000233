Source data (sourcedata/) and stimuli (stimuli/) may contain sensitive or proprietary information and therefore not distributed publicly. Contact the authors for more information on stimuli.

Note that in constructing the trial order for one run
(sub-rid0000*_task-beh_run-1_bold.nii.gz) an unintended collision occurred where a behavior repetition event interrupted a taxonomic repetition event. This means that one less taxonomic category repetition occurred in this run (3 in stead of 4), and the stimulus bird_eating_1.mp4 occurred 3 times instead of the intended 2 times in this run.
